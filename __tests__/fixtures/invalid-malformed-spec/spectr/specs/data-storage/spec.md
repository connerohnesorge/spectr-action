# Data Storage

## Purpose

This capability handles persistent data storage and retrieval operations for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Data Persistence

The system SHALL persist all user data to a durable storage backend.

- **Scenario: Save operation successful**
- **WHEN** a user saves their data
- **THEN** the data is written to persistent storage
- **AND** a success confirmation is returned

**Scenario**: Load operation successful

- **WHEN** a user requests their saved data
- **THEN** the previously saved data is retrieved
- **AND** returned to the user

### Requirement: Data Integrity

The system MUST ensure data integrity through validation and checksums.

### Scenario: Data validation on write

- **WHEN** data is written to storage
- **THEN** validation checks are performed
- **AND** checksums are calculated and stored

- **Scenario: Corrupted data detection**
- **WHEN** data is read from storage
- **THEN** checksums are verified
- **AND** corrupted data is flagged

### Requirement: Concurrent Access

The system SHALL handle concurrent read and write operations safely.

**Scenario: Multiple readers**

- **WHEN** multiple users read the same data simultaneously
- **THEN** all readers receive consistent data
- **AND** no read operation blocks others
