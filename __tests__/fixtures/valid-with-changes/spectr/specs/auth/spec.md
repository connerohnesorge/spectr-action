# Authentication

## Purpose

This capability handles user authentication and access control for the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Basic Authentication

The system SHALL authenticate users using username and password credentials.

#### Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials

- **WHEN** a user provides a valid username and password
- **THEN** the system returns a JWT authentication token
- **AND** the token is valid for 24 hours

#### Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials

- **WHEN** a user provides invalid credentials
- **THEN** the system returns an authentication error
- **AND** no token is issued
- **AND** the failed attempt is logged

### Requirement: Session Management

The system MUST maintain user session state after successful authentication.

#### Scenario: Token validation on protected endpoints

- **WHEN** a user accesses a protected endpoint with a valid token
- **THEN** the system grants access to the resource
- **AND** refreshes the token expiration

#### Scenario: Token expiration handling

- **WHEN** a user accesses a protected endpoint with an expired token
- **THEN** the system returns an unauthorized error
- **AND** requires re-authentication
