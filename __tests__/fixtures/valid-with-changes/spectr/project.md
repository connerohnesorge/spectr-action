# Test Project with Changes

A valid Spectr project for testing with active change proposals.

## Conventions

### File Organization

- Specs are organized by capability under `specs/`
- Each capability has its own directory containing `spec.md`
- Changes are organized under `changes/` with spec deltas

### Requirement Format

- Requirements use SHALL or MUST for normative statements
- Each requirement includes at least one scenario
- Scenarios use WHEN/THEN structure for clarity

### Naming Conventions

- Capability directories use kebab-case
- Change directories use kebab-case with verb prefixes
- Requirements use clear, descriptive titles
